# How to contribute to Learn Relay

We're glad that you are interested in contributing to Learn Relay! :tada:

## Contributing to the Pokedex app

If you have a suggestion on how to improve the Pokedex app please either [open an issue](https://github.com/learnrelay/pokedex/issues/new) or read along to find out how to create a pull request.

We want to provide a seamless step-by-step workflow to everyone working with the Pokedex app. In particular, we use a branch-based setup where for every exercise that appears in the [Learn Relay guide](https://github.com/learnrelay/learnrelay/), two branches exist. For example for the third exercise
* the branch `step-03` serves as a starting point
* the branch `step-03-solution` serves as a reference solution so everyone can get a few hints on how a solution could look like

These branches should never be worked on manually. In fact, all work should be done in the separate folders that exist on the `master` branch. So if you want to contribute something to the third exercise
* checkout the `master` branch
* make your changes to the folders `branch-step-03` and `branch-step-03-solution`
* create a PR

After merging your PR, we will run a script that converts the folders to branches.

## Contributing to the interactive guide

This application is part of the [Learn Relay interactive guide](https://github.com/learnrelay/learnrelay/). If your changes to the Pokedex app need to be reflected in the actual guide as well or if you want to contribute something to the main guide as well, head over to [the Learn Relay project](https://github.com/learnrelay/learnrelay/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
